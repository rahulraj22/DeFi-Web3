## DeFi Application | Motoko Prog. Language | IC (Internet Computer)

- Built a real-life `DeFi` (Decentralized Finance) application using Motoko programming language for developing applications on `IC` (Internet Computer) platform.
- Internet Computer is a blockchain-based decentralized computing platform developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to provide a scalable and secure environment for hosting smart contracts and dApps (decentralized applications) without the need for traditional web infrastructure.
- `Motoko` is a high-level, functional programming language that provides developers with tools and abstractions for building scalable and secure smart contracts and dApps.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
